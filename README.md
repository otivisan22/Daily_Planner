# Daily_Planner

## Description

Our task was to create a daily planner in order to add important events in the schedule for any employee with a busy schedule. Following the busy schedule on an employee this daily planner needs to save each activity that has been added to the schedule. On the other hand we have timeblocks that will indicate important events whether it is in the past, future or present.
